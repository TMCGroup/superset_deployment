# Superset Deployment using Ansible

This is playbook/notebook combo is intended for educational purposes only! Though with a little tidy up it could be a viable script for deploying Superset to any server.

See the Jupyter notebook for details about how the Ansible playbook was constructed.

Install Ansible with, on a Mac: `brew install ansible`.

Run the playbook with: `ansible-playbook deploy_superset.yml`

Do remember to change any paths to your own!
